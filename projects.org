* Academic projects

 [fn::{-} [[./images/communities.png]]]

** Master's thesis: [[https://github.com/dlozeve/tda-networks][Topological Data Analysis of time-dependent networks]]

Application of the recent advances in Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
and Persistent Homology to periodicity detection in temporal
networks. [[./files/tdanetworks.pdf][Master's thesis dissertation]].

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/community-detection][Community detection]]

Community detection algorithms and applications to a large social
network obtained from Prestashop data. [[https://dlozeve.github.io/reveal_CommunityDetection/#/][Slides (in French)]].

* Personal projects

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/ising-model][Ising model simulation]]

 [fn::{-} [[./images/ising.gif]]]

Monte Carlo simulation of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model][Ising model]] using
Metropolis-Hastings. [[./posts/ising-model.html][Associated blog post.]] (Clojure)

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/lsystems][L-systems]]

Generate and draw L-systems. (Haskell)

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/reaction-diffusion][Reaction-diffusion system]]

 [fn::{-} [[./images/reactiondiffusion.png]]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction%E2%80%93diffusion_system][Reaction-Diffusion system]] simulation using the Gray-Scott
model. ([[https://www.dyalog.com/][Dyalog APL]])

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/GardenOptim][GardenOptim]]

Optimization of a vegetable garden: optimal allocation of plant
species on a non-rectangular garden subdivided in individual cells,
with constraints from an affinity matrix between neighboring
species. Uses mixed integer quadratic programming and Markov chain
Monte Carlo.

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/Satrap][Satrap]]

Simple ARP spoofer, allowing for interception and modification of all
communications between two targets. It sends ARP packets to perform a
man-in-the-middle attack. (C)

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/orbit][Orbit]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation][N-body]] simulator. (Haskell)

** [[https://github.com/dlozeve/Civilisation-hs][Civilisation]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem][SAT solver]], using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm][Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland]] (DPLL)
algorithm. (Haskell)

** [[https://dlozeve.github.io/ww2-bombings][WWII bombing visualization]]

Every allied bombing during WWII, mapped over the whole world. The
data has been released by the U.S. Department of Defense [[https://data.world/datamil/world-war-ii-thor-data][here]].

** [[https://dlozeve.github.io/adsb][ADS-B data visualization]]

Visualization of plane trajectories over Northeastern France. The data
was gathered using a Software Defined Radio to listen to aircrafts.
