[fn::{-} The phrase "for fun and profit" seems to be a pretty old
expression: according to the answers to [[https://english.stackexchange.com/q/25205][this StackExchange question]],
it might date back to Horace's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Poetica_(Horace)][/Ars Poetica/]] ("prodesse et
delectare"). I like the idea that books (and ideas!) should be both
instructive and enjoyable...]

While exploring [[./quaternions.html][quaternions]] and the theory behind them, I noticed an
interesting pattern: in the exposition of
cite:sola2017_quater_kinem_error_state_kalman_filter, quaternions and
rotations matrices had exactly the same properties, and the derivation
of these properties was rigorously identical (bar some minor notation
changes).

This is expected because in this specific case, these are just two
representations of the same underlying object: rotations. However,
from a purely mathematical and abstract point of view, it cannot be a
coincidence that you can imbue two different types of objects with
exactly the same properties.

Indeed, this is not a coincidence: the important structure that is
common to the set of rotation matrices and to the set of quaternions
is that of a /Lie group/.

* Why would that be interesting?

From a mathematical point of view, seeing a common structure like this
should raise alarm signals in our heads. Is there a deeper concept at
play here? If we can find that two objects are two examples of the
same abstract structure, maybe we'll also be able to identify that
structure elsewhere, maybe where it's less obvious. And then, if we
prove interesting theorems on the abstract structure, we'll
essentially get the same theorems on every example of this structure,
and /for free!/ (i.e. without any additional work!)[fn:structure]

[fn:structure]{-} When you push that idea to its extremes, you get
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory][category theory]], which is just the study of (abstract) structure. This
in a fun rabbit hole to get into, and if you're interested, I
recommend the amazing [[https://www.math3ma.com/][math3ma]] blog, or
cite:riehlCategoryTheoryContext2017 for a complete and approachable
treatment. cite:fongSevenSketchesCompositionality2018 gives an
interesting perspective on why category theory is interesting in the
real world.


We can think of it as a kind of factorization: instead of doing the
same thing over and over, we can basically do it /once/ and recall the
general result whenever it is needed, as one would define a function
and call it later in a piece of software.

In this case, Lie theory provides a general framework for manipulating
objects that we want to /combine/ and on which we'd like to compute
/derivatives/. Differentiability is an essentially linear property, in
the sense that it works best in vector spaces. Indeed, think of what
you do to with a derivative: you want to /add/ it to other stuff to
represent increase rates or uncertainties.

Once you can differentiate, a whole new world
opens[fn:differentiability]: optimization becomes easier (because you
can use gradient descent), you can have random variables, and so on.

[fn:differentiability] This is why a lot of programming languages now
try to make differentiability a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming][first-class concept]]. The ability to
differentiate arbitrary programs is a huge bonus for all kinds of
operations common in scientific computing. Pioneering advances were
made in deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch; but
recent advances are even more exciting. [[https://github.com/google/jax][JAX]] is basically a
differentiable Numpy, and Julia has always made differentiable
programming a priority, via projects such as [[https://www.juliadiff.org/][JuliaDiff]] and [[https://fluxml.ai/Zygote.jl/][Zygote]].


In the case of quaternions, we can define explicitly a differentiation
operator, and prove that it has all the nice properties that we come
to expect from derivatives. Wouldn't it be nice if we could have all
of this automatically? Lie theory gives us the general framework in
which we can imbue non-"linear" objects with differentiability.

* The structure of a Lie group

Continuing on the example of rotations, what common properties can we
identify?

1. Quaternions and rotation matrices can be multiplied together (to
   compose rotations), have an identity element, along with nice
   properties.
2. Quaternions and rotation matrices can be differentiated, and we can
   map them with usual vectors.

These two group of properties actually correspond to common
mathematical structures: a /group/ and a /differentiable manifold/.

You're probably already familiar with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)][groups]], but let's recall the
basic properties:
- It's a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot$.
- The group is closed under the operation: for any element $x,y$ in G,
  $x \cdot y$ is always in $G$.
- The operation is associative: $x \cdot (y \cdot z) = (x \cdot y)
  \cdot z$.
- There is a special element $e$ of $G$ (called the /identity
  element/), such that $x \cdot e = e \cdot x$ for all $x \in G$.
- For every element $x$ of $G$, there is a unique element of $G$
  denoted $x^{-1}$ such that $x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = e$.

A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold][differentiable manifold]] is a more complex beast. Although the
definition is more complex, we can loosely imagine it as a surface (in
higher dimension) on which we can compute derivatives at every
point. This means that there is a tangent hyperplane at each point,
which is a nice vector space where our derivatives will live.

You can think of the manifold as a tablecloth that has a weird shape,
all kinds of curvatures, but no edges or spikes. The idea here is that
we can define an /atlas/, i.e. a local approximation of the manifold
as a plane. The name is telling: they're called atlases because they
play the exact same role as maps. The Earth is not flat, it is a
sphere with all kinds of deformations (mountains, canyons, oceans),
but we can have maps that represent a small area with a very good
precision. Similarly, atlases are the vector spaces that provide the
best linear approximation of a small region around a point on the
manifold.

So we know what a group and a differential manifold are. As it turns
out, that's all we need to know! What we have defined so far is a /Lie
group/[fn:lie], i.e. a group that is also a differentiable
manifold. The tangent vector space at the identity element is called
the /Lie algebra/.

To take the example of rotation matrices:
- We can combine them (i.e. by matrix multiplication): they form a
  group.
- If we have a function $R : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow
  \mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ defining a trajectory (e.g. the
  successive attitudes of a object in space), we can find derivatives
  of this trajectory! They would represent instantaneous orientation
  change, or angular velocities.

[fn:lie] {-} Lie theory is named after [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophus_Lie][Sophus Lie]], a Norwegian
mathematician. As such, "Lie" is pronounced /lee/. Lie was inspired by
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois][Galois']] work on algebraic equations, and wanted to establish a similar
general theory for differential equations.

* Interesting properties of Lie groups

For a complete overview of Lie theory, there are a lot of interesting
material that you can find online.[fn:princeton_companion] I
especially recommend the tutorial by
cite:sola2018_micro_lie_theor_state_estim_robot: just enough maths to
understand what is going on, but without losing track of the
applications. There is also a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR1p0Rabuww][video tutorial]] for the [[https://www.iros2020.org/][IROS2020]]
conference[fn::More specifically for the workshop on [[https://sites.google.com/view/iros2020-geometric-methods/][Bringing
geometric methods to robot learning, optimization and control]].]. For a
more complete treatment, cite:stillwell2008_naive_lie_theor is
great.[fn::{-} John Stillwell is one of the best textbook writers. All
his books are extremely clear and a pleasure to read. You generally
read a book because you're interested in learning the topic; you begin
learning a topic just because Stillwell wrote a book on it.]

[fn:princeton_companion] {-} There is also a chapter on Lie theory in
the amazing /Princeton Companion to Mathematics/
[[citep:gowersPrincetonCompanionMathematics2010][::, Â§II.48]].


The Lie group is a set of elements. At every element, there is a
tangent vector space. The tangent vector space at the identity is
called the Lie algebra, and as we will see, it plays a special role.

* Applications

Lie theory is useful because it gives strong theoretical guarantees
whenever we need to linearize something. If you have a system evolving
on a complex geometric structure (for example, the space of rotations,
which is definitely not linear), but you need to use a linear
operation (if you need uncertainties, or you have differential
equations), you have to approximate somehow.

Using the Lie structure of the underlying space, you immediately get a
principled way of defining derivatives, random variables, and so on.
