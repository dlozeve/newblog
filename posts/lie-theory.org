[fn::{-} The phrase "for fun and profit" seems to be a pretty old
expression: according to the answers to [[https://english.stackexchange.com/q/25205][this StackExchange question]],
it might date back to Horace's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Poetica_(Horace)][/Ars Poetica/]] ("prodesse et
delectare"). I like the idea that books (and ideas!) should be both
instructive and enjoyable...]
