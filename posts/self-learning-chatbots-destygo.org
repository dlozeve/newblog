title: "Destygo: Towards Self-Learning Chatbots"

Last week I made a presentation at the
[[https://www.meetup.com/Paris-NLP/][Paris NLP Meetup]], on how we
implemented self-learning chatbots in production at Destygo.

It was fascinating to other people interested in NLP about the
technologies and models we deploy at work! It's always nice to have
some feedback about our work, and preparing this talk forced me to
take a step back about what we do and rethink it in new interesting
ways.

Also check out the
[[https://nlpparis.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/paris-nlp-season-3-meetup-4-at-meilleursagents/][other
presentations]], one about diachronic (i.e. time-dependent) word
embeddings and the other about the different models and the use of
Knowledge Bases for Information Retrieval. (This might even give us
new ideas to explore...)

If you're interested about exciting applications at the confluence of
Reinforcement Learning and NLP, the slides are available
[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aS1NpPxRzsQCsAqoQIVZrdf8R1Y2VKrT/view][here]]. It
includes basic RL theory, how we transposed it to the specific case of
conversational agents, the technical and mathematical challenges in
implementing self-learning chatbots, and of course plenty of
references for further reading if we piqued your interest!
