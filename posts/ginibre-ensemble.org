** Ginibre ensemble and its properties

   The /Ginibre ensemble/ is a set of random matrices with the entries
   chosen independently. Each entry of a $n \times n$ matrix is a complex
   number, with both the real and imaginary part sampled from a normal
   distribution of mean zero and variance $1/2n$.

   Random matrices distributions are very complex and are a very
   active subject of research. I stumbled on this example while
   reading an article in /Notices of the AMS/ by Brian C. Hall [[ref-1][(1)]].

   Now what is interesting about these random matrices is the
   distribution of their $n$ eigenvalues in the complex plane.

   The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_law][circular law]] (first established by Jean Ginibre in 1965 [[ref-2][(2)]])
   states that when $n$ is large, with high probability, almost all
   the eigenvalues lie in the unit disk. Moreover, they tend to be
   nearly uniformly distributed there.

   I find this mildly fascinating that such a straightforward definition
   of a random matrix can exhibit such non-random properties in their
   spectrum.

** Simulation

   I ran a quick simulation, thanks to [[https://julialang.org/][Julia]]'s great ecosystem for linear
   algebra and statistical distributions:

   #+begin_src julia
     using Distributions
     using LinearAlgebra
     using UnicodePlots

     function ginibre(n)
	 d = Normal(0, sqrt(1/2n))
	 reshape(rand(d, n^2), (n,n)) + im*reshape(rand(d, n^2), (n,n))
     end

     v = eigvals(ginibre(2000))

     scatterplot(real(v), imag(v), xlim=[-1.5,1.5], ylim=[-1.5,1.5])
   #+end_src

   I like using =UnicodePlots= for this kind of quick-and-dirty plots,
   directly in the terminal. Here is the output:
