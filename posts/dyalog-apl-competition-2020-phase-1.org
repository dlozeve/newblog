* 1. Let's Split!

#+begin_quote
Write a function that, given a right argument ~Y~ which is a scalar or
a non-empty vector and a left argument ~X~ which is a single non-zero
integer so that its absolute value is less or equal to ~≢Y~, splits
~Y~ into a vector of two vectors according to ~X~, as follows:

If ~X>0~, the first vector contains the first ~X~ elements of ~Y~ and
the second vector contains the remaining elements.

If ~X<0~, the second vector contains the last ~|X~ elements of ~Y~ and
the first vector contains the remaining elements.
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~(0>⊣)⌽((⊂↑),(⊂↓))~

There are three nested trains here[fn:trains]. The first one,
~((⊂↑),(⊂↓))~, uses the two functions [[https://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Take.htm][Take]] (~↑~) and [[https://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Drop.htm][Drop]] (~↓~) to
build a nested array consisting of the two outputs we need. (Take and
Drop already have the behaviour needed regarding negative arguments.)
However, if the left argument is positive, the two arrays will not be
in the correct order. So we need a way to reverse them if ~X<0~.

[fn:trains] Trains are nice to read (even if they are easy to abuse),
and generally make for shorter dfns, which is better for Phase I.


The second train ~(0>⊣)~ will return 1 if its left argument is
positive. From this, we can use [[https://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Rotate.htm][Rotate]] (~⌽~) to correctly order the
nested array, in the last train.

* 2. Character Building

#+begin_quote
UTF-8 encodes Unicode characters using 1-4 integers for each
character. Dyalog APL includes a system function, ~⎕UCS~, that can
convert characters into integers and integers into characters. The
expression ~'UTF-8'∘⎕UCS~ converts between characters and UTF-8.

Consider the following:

      #+begin_src default
      'UTF-8'∘⎕UCS 'D¥⍺⌊○9'
68 194 165 226 141 186 226 140 138 226 151 139 57
      'UTF-8'∘⎕UCS 68 194 165 226 141 186 226 140 138 226 151 139 57
D¥⍺⌊○9
      #+end_src

How many integers does each character use?

      #+begin_src default
      'UTF-8'∘⎕UCS¨ 'D¥⍺⌊○9' ⍝ using ]Boxing on
┌──┬───────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────────┬──┐
│68│194 165│226 141 186│226 140 138│226 151 139│57│
└──┴───────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴──┘      
      #+end_src

The rule is that an integer in the range 128 to 191 (inclusive)
continues the character of the previous integer (which may itself be a
continuation). With that in mind, write a function that, given a right
argument which is a simple integer vector representing valid UTF-8
text, encloses each sequence of integers that represent a single
character, like the result of ~'UTF-8'∘⎕UCS¨'UTF-8'∘⎕UCS~ but does not
use any system functions (names beginning with ~⎕~)
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~{(~⍵∊127+⍳64)⊂⍵}~

First, we build a binary array from the string, encoding each
continuation character as 0, and all the others as 1. Next, we can use
this binary array with [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Partitioned%20Enclose.htm][Partitioned Enclose]] (~⊂~) to return the correct
output.

* 3. Excel-lent Columns

#+begin_quote
A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet numbers its rows counting up
from 1. However Excel's columns are labelled alphabetically —
beginning with A–Z, then AA–AZ, BA–BZ, up to ZA–ZZ, then AAA–AAZ and
so on.

Write a function that, given a right argument which is a character
scalar or non-empty vector representing a valid character Excel column
identifier between A and XFD, returns the corresponding column number
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~26⊥⎕A∘⍳~

We use the alphabet ~⎕A~ and [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Index%20Of.htm][Index Of]] (~⍳~) to compute the index in
the alphabet of every character. As a train, this can be done by
~(⎕A∘⍳)~. We then obtain an array of numbers, each representing a
letter from 1 to 26. The [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Decode.htm][Decode]] (~⊥~) function can then turn this
base-26 number into the expected result.

* 4. Take a Leap

#+begin_quote
Write a function that, given a right argument which is an integer
array of year numbers greater than or equal to 1752 and less than
4000, returns a result of the same shape as the right argument where 1
indicates that the corresponding year is a leap year (0 otherwise).

A leap year algorithm can be found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year#Algorithm][here]].
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~1 3∊⍨(0+.=400 100 4∘.|⊢)~

According to the algorithm, a year is a leap year in two situations:
- if it is divisible by 4, but not 100 (and therefore not 400),
- if it is divisible by 400 (and therefore 4 and 100 as well).

The train ~(400 100 4∘.|⊢)~ will test if each year in the right
argument is divisible by 400, 100, and 4, using an [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Operators/Outer%20Product.htm][Outer Product]]. We
then use an [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Operators/Inner%20Product.htm][Inner Product]] to count how many times each year is
divisible by one of these numbers. If the count is 1 or 3, it is a
leap year. Note that we use [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Operators/Commute.htm][Commute]] (~⍨~) to keep the dfn as a train,
and to preserve the natural right-to-left reading of the algorithm.

* 5. Stepping in the Proper Direction

#+begin_quote
Write a function that, given a right argument of 2 integers, returns a
vector of the integers from the first element of the right argument to
the second, inclusively.
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~{(⊃⍵)+(-×-/⍵)×0,⍳|-/⍵}~

First, we have to compute the range of the output, which is the
absolute value of the difference between the two integers ~|-/⍵~. From
this, we compute the actual sequence, including zero[fn::If we had
~⎕IO←0~, we could have written ~⍳|1+-/⍵~, but this is the same number
of characters.]: ~0,⍳|-/⍵~.

This sequence will always be nondecreasing, but we have to make it
decreasing if needed, so we multiply it by the opposite of the sign of
~-/⍵~. Finally, we just have to start the sequence at the first
element of ~⍵~.

* 6. Please Move to the Front

#+begin_quote
Write a function that, given a right argument which is an integer
vector and a left argument which is an integer scalar, reorders the
right argument so any elements equal to the left argument come first
while all other elements keep their order.
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~{⍵[⍋⍺≠⍵]}~

~⍺≠⍵~ will return a binary vector marking as 0 all elements equal to
the left argument. Using this index to sort in the usual way with
[[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Grade%20Up%20Monadic.htm][Grade Up]] will return the expected result.

* 7. See You in a Bit

#+begin_quote
A common technique for encoding a set of on/off states is to use a
value of $2^n$ for the state in position $n$ (origin 0), 1 if the
state is "on" or 0 for "off" and then add the values. Dyalog APL's
[[https://help.dyalog.com/17.1/#Language/APL%20Component%20Files/Component%20Files.htm#File_Access_Control][component file permission codes]] are an example of this. For example,
if you wanted to grant permissions for read (access code 1), append
(access code 8) and rename (access code 128) then the resulting code
would be 137 because that's 1 + 8 + 128.

Write a function that, given a non-negative right argument which is an
integer scalar representing the encoded state and a left argument
which is an integer scalar representing the encoded state settings
that you want to query, returns 1 if all of the codes in the left
argument are found in the right argument (0 otherwise).
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~{f←⍸∘⌽(2∘⊥⍣¯1)⋄∧/(f⍺)∊f⍵}~

The difficult part is to find the set of states for an integer. We
need a function that will return ~1 8 128~ (or an equivalent
representation) for an input of ~137~. To do this, we need the base-2
representations of $137 = 1 + 8 + 128 = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^7 =
10010001_2$. The function ~(2∘⊥⍣¯1)~ will return the base-2
representation of its argument, and by [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Reverse.htm][reversing]] and finding [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Where.htm][where]] the
non-zero elements are, we find the correct exponents (~1 3 7~ in this
case). That is what the function ~f~ does.

Next, we just need to check that all elements of ~f⍺~ are also in
~f⍵~.

* 8. Zigzag Numbers

#+begin_quote
A zigzag number is an integer in which the difference in magnitude of
each pair of consecutive digits alternates from positive to negative
or negative to positive.

Write a function that takes a single integer greater than or equal to
100 and less than 10^{15} as its right argument and returns a 1 if the
integer is a zigzag number, 0 otherwise.
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~∧/2=∘|2-/∘×2-/(10∘⊥⍣¯1)~

First, we decompose a number into an array of digits, using
~(10∘⊥⍣¯1)~ ([[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Decode.htm][Decode]] (~⊥~) in base 10). Then, we [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Operators/Reduce%20N%20Wise.htm][Reduce N Wise]] to
compute the difference between each pair of digits, take the sign, and
ensure that the signs are indeed alternating.

* 9. Rise and Fall

#+begin_quote
Write a function that, given a right argument which is an integer
scalar or vector, returns a 1 if the values of the right argument
conform to the following pattern (0 otherwise):

- The elements increase or stay the same until the "apex" (highest
  value) is reached
- After the apex, any remaining values decrease or remain the same
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~{∧/(⍳∘≢≡⍋)¨(⊂((⊢⍳⌈/)↑⊢),⍵),⊂⌽((⊢⍳⌈/)↓⊢),⍵}~

How do we approach this? First we have to split the vector at the
"apex". The train ~(⊢⍳⌈/)~ will return the [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Index%20Of.htm][index of]] (~⍳~) the maximum
element. 

#+begin_src default
      (⊢⍳⌈/)1 3 3 4 5 2 1
5
#+end_src

Combined with [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Take.htm][Take]] (~↑~) and [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Drop.htm][Drop]] (~↓~), we build a two-element vector
containing both parts, in ascending order (we [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Reverse.htm][Reverse]] (~⌽~) one of
them). Note that we have to [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Ravel.htm][Ravel]] (~,~) the argument to avoid rank
errors in Index Of.

#+begin_src default
      {(⊂((⊢⍳⌈/)↑⊢),⍵),⊂⌽((⊢⍳⌈/)↓⊢),⍵}1 3 3 4 5 2 1
┌─────────┬───┐
│1 3 3 4 5│1 2│
└─────────┴───┘
#+end_src

Next, ~(⍳∘≢≡⍋)~ on each of the two vectors will test if they are
non-decreasing (i.e. if the ranks of all the elements correspond to a
simple range from 1 to the size of the vector).

* 10. Stacking It Up

#+begin_quote
Write a function that takes as its right argument a vector of simple
arrays of rank 2 or less (scalar, vector, or matrix). Each simple
array will consist of either non-negative integers or printable ASCII
characters. The function must return a simple character array that
displays identically to what ~{⎕←⍵}¨~ displays when applied to the
right argument.
#+end_quote

*Solution:* ~{↑⊃,/↓¨⍕¨⍵}~

The first step is to [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Format%20Monadic.htm][Format]] (~⍕~) everything to get
strings.[fn:trial-error] The next step would be to "stack everything
vertically", so we will need [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Mix.htm][Mix]] (~↑~) at some point. However, if we
do it immediately we don't get the correct result:

[fn:trial-error] {-} A lot of trial-and-error is always necessary when
dealing with nested arrays, and this being about formatting
exacerbates the problem.


#+begin_src default
      {↑⍕¨⍵}(3 3⍴⍳9)(↑'Adam' 'Michael')
1 2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 9  
       
Adam   
Michael
#+end_src

Mix is padding with spaces both horizontally (necessary as we want the
output to be a simple array of characters) and vertically (not what we
want). We will have to decompose everything line by line, and then mix
all the lines together. This is exactly what [[https://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Split.htm][Split]][fn::Split is the
dual of Mix.] (~↓~) does:

#+begin_src default
      {↓¨⍕¨⍵}(3 3⍴⍳9)(↑'Adam' 'Michael')(⍳10) '*'(5 5⍴⍳25)
┌───────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────────┬─┬───────────────
│┌─────┬─────┬─────┐│┌───────┬───────┐│┌────────────────────┐│*│┌──────────────
││1 2 3│4 5 6│7 8 9│││Adam   │Michael│││1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10││ ││ 1  2  3  4  5
│└─────┴─────┴─────┘│└───────┴───────┘│└────────────────────┘│ │└──────────────
└───────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────────────┴─┴───────────────

      ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

      ┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘│
      ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
#+end_src

Next, we clean this up with Ravel (~,~) and we can Mix to obtain the
final result.
