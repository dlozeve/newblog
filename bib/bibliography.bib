                  includes an in-depth study of the rotation group and

                  quaternions and rotation matrices. It makes special
                  attention in the definition of rotation
                  perturbations, derivatives and integrals. It
                  provides numerous intuitions and geometrical
                  interpretations to help the reader grasp the inner
                  mechanisms of 3D rotation.  The whole material is

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

  abstract =	 {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object
                  dating back to the XIX century, when mathematician
                  Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of
                  continuous transformation groups. As it often
                  happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of
                  science and technology many years later. In
                  robotics, we are recently experiencing an important
                  trend in its usage, at least in the fields of
                  estimation, and particularly in motion estimation
                  for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of
                  roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract
                  constructions and therefore difficult to understand
                  and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of
                  the literature on Lie theory is written by and for
                  mathematicians and physicists, who might be more
                  used than us to the deep abstractions this theory
                  deals with.  In estimation for robotics it is often
                  not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the
                  theory, and therefore an effort of selection of
                  materials is required. In this paper, we will walk
                  through the most basic principles of the Lie theory,
                  with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas,
                  and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory
                  behind. Even with this mutilation, the material
                  included here has proven to be extremely useful in
                  modern estimation algorithms for robotics,
                  especially in the fields of SLAM, visual odometry,
                  and the like.  Alongside this micro Lie theory, we
                  provide a chapter with a few application examples,
                  and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie
                  groups used in robotics, including most jacobian
                  matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We
                  also present a new C++ template-only library
                  implementing all the functionality described here.},
