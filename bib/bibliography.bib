                  3D space, and their proper use in estimation engines
                  such as the error-state Kalman filter.  The paper
                  includes an in-depth study of the rotation group and
                  its Lie structure, with formulations using both
                  quaternions and rotation matrices. It makes special
                  attention in the definition of rotation
                  perturbations, derivatives and integrals. It
                  provides numerous intuitions and geometrical
                  interpretations to help the reader grasp the inner
                  mechanisms of 3D rotation.  The whole material is
                  used to devise precise formulations for error-state
                  Kalman filters suited for real applications using
                  integration of signals from an inertial measurement

  abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},
