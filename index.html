<p>
  Hi! I am an Engineering Manager at
  <a href="https://www.doctrine.fr/">Doctrine</a>, where we develop productivity
  tools to help lawyers analyze and write their private documents.
</p>

<p>
  I was previously a Research Engineer and Project Manager at
  <a href="https://www.sysnav.fr/">Sysnav</a>, where I worked on developing
  algorithms to help physicians measure the progress of neuromuscular diseases.
  We used data from inertial sensors to extract meaningful variables for
  pharmaceutical studies.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I was a Data Scientist at
  <a href="https://www.mindsay.com/">Mindsay</a>, working on natural language
  understanding for chatbots.
</p>
