    I am an Engineering Manager at
    <a href="https://www.doctrine.fr/">Doctrine</a>, where we develop
    productivity tools to help lawyers analyze and write their private
    documents.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was previously a Research Engineer and Project Manager at
    <a href="https://www.sysnav.fr/">Sysnav</a>, where I worked on developing
    algorithms to help physicians measure the progress of neuromuscular
    diseases. We used data from inertial sensors to extract meaningful variables
    for pharmaceutical studies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before that, I was a Data Scientist at Mindsay, working on natural language
    understanding for chatbots.
